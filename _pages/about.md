I am Andy Dao, a Computer Science student at the University of Houston with a strong interest in software development and problem-solving. My academic focus includes data structures, algorithms, and web development, where I enjoy turning abstract concepts into practical, working systems. Through my coursework and personal projects, I’ve developed a solid foundation in C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Git, and I am actively preparing for software engineering internship opportunities.

Outside the classroom, I am the founder of a Mobile Auto Detailing Business, where I manage operations end-to-end, including scheduling, customer communication, and payments. To support the business, I designed and built a responsive website that showcases services and strengthens the brand’s online presence. Balancing entrepreneurship with school has strengthened my time management skills and taught me how to apply technical knowledge to real-world problems.

In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I am deeply involved in basketball. I regularly play and lift weights to maintain discipline and physical conditioning, and I also coach a competitive basketball team that has competed against universities across Texas. As a Sports Coordinator and coach, I’ve gained leadership experience through organizing practices, managing teams, and mentoring players. These experiences have shaped my teamwork, communication, and leadership skills—qualities I bring into both technical projects and collaborative environments.
